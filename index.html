  	<p>I am a hardworking and passionate creative mind who has always viewed my endeavors from an analytical and technical lens.  I love and cherish work that enables me to create from my subjective state of mind, but have a nagging urge to understand the mechanics in order to create a frame work to fill with my creativity.  I tried various artistic mediums growing up, but eventually found that music was my vehicle of choice.  Over 23 years of experience, a Bachelorâ€™s Degree from The Berklee College of Music, and professional work, I have sharpened my skills to do exactly that.

  	<p>I am now turning my eye to web design because I firmly believe I have to ability to learn the language and technicalities, while applying my creative drive to thrive in a professional environment.  This page is the beginning of my journey and I hope you will enjoy my projects as I continue grow and learn.  Here's to a new road!</p>
